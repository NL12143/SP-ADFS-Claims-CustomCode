#Highlights of drop #2

This is the second drop of the new "Claims Identity Guide" edition. In this release you will find:
All 3 samples for ACS v2: ("ACS as a Federation Provider", "ACS as a FP with Multiple Business Partners" and "ACS and REST endpoints"). 
This sample extend all the original "Federation samples" in the guide with new capabilities (e.g. protocol transition, REST services, etc).
Two ACS specific chapters.

In addition to these, you will also find:
All previous samples updated and enhanced (all first 5 scenarios).
All code upgraded to .NET 4 and Visual Studio 2010.
Refactored Simulated Issuers: each solution now gets its own issuers. This results in much cleaner and simpler to understand code.
Added Single Sign Out support.
Enhanced Dependency Checker! (doesn't require PowerShell, better UI).
