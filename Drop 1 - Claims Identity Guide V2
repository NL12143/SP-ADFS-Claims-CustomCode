#Highlights of drop #1

This is the first drop of the new "Claims Identity Guide" edition. In this release you will find:
All previous samples updated and enhanced.
All code upgraded to .NET 4 and Visual Studio 2010.
Refactored Simulated Issuers: each solution now gets its own issuers. This results in much cleaner and simpler to understand code.
Added Single Sign Out support.
Added first sample using ACS ("ACS as a Federation Provider"). This sample extends the original "Federation sample".
First ACS chapter.
Enhanced Dependency Checker! (doesn't require PowerShell, better UI).
